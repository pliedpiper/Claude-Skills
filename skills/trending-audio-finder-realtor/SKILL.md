# Trending Audio Finder

Find current trending sounds for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and Facebook, with adaptation guidance for real estate content.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Search for Current Trends

Run multiple web searches to gather trending audio data:

```
Search queries (run 2-3):
- "trending tiktok sounds this week [current month year]"
- "viral instagram reels audio [current month year]"
- "trending songs for reels [current month year]"
```

Prioritize results from these reliable sources:
- **Tokboard** (tokboard.com) - Real-time TikTok sound rankings
- **TikTok Creative Center** (ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter) - Official trending data
- **Later Blog** - Weekly trending sound roundups
- **Hootsuite Blog** - Social media trend reports
- **Kapwing Resources** - Trending audio compilations

### Step 2: Curate the List

From search results, identify 5-8 sounds that meet these criteria:
- Currently trending (within past 2 weeks)
- Appropriate for professional/brand content
- Versatile enough for real estate adaptation
- Mix of categories: upbeat, emotional, funny, motivational

For each sound, gather:
- Sound name and original artist (if applicable)
- Direct link to TikTok/Instagram sound page when available
- Current usage context (what types of videos use it)
- Vibe/mood category

### Step 3: Generate Realtor Adaptations

For each sound, provide a specific real estate content idea. Consider these content themes:

**First-Time Buyer Focus:**
- Home tour reveals and reactions
- "Things I wish I knew" educational content
- Mortgage/financing tips made simple
- Move-in day celebrations
- Before/after transformation reveals

**General Realtor Content:**
- Day-in-the-life clips
- Market update snippets
- Client testimonial moments
- Open house energy
- Neighborhood highlights
- Behind-the-scenes showing prep

Match sound vibes to content types:
- **Upbeat/energetic** → Home tours, open houses, sold celebrations
- **Emotional/sentimental** → Client stories, move-in days, dream home reveals
- **Funny/quirky** → Realtor life moments, market commentary, relatable struggles
- **Motivational** → First-time buyer encouragement, "you can do this" content
- **Trending dialogue/memes** → Adapt the format with real estate scenarios

### Fallback Strategy

If primary sources don't yield enough current results:
- Expand time range to past month instead of past 2 weeks
- Include evergreen viral sounds that remain consistently popular
- Note any data freshness limitations to the user
- Suggest the user check TikTok's Discover page directly for real-time trends

## Output Format

Deliver results in this structure:

```
## Trending Sounds This Week

### 1. [Sound Name]
**Artist:** [Original artist if applicable]
**Link:** [URL to sound on TikTok/Instagram]
**Vibe:** [Category - upbeat/emotional/funny/motivational]
**Currently used for:** [Brief description of trending usage]

**Realtor Adaptation:** [Specific content idea with brief description]

---
[Repeat for each sound]
```

## Required Closing Notes

Always include these tips at the end of every response:
- Sounds trend for 1-3 weeks typically; act fast on production
- Save sounds to favorites immediately for later use
- Check sound usage count—sweet spot is trending but not oversaturated
- Some sounds are region-locked; test before planning content around them
- Remix/mashup versions sometimes perform better than originals
- **Verify links before use**—sound URLs may change or become unavailable; search directly in the app if a link doesn't work
