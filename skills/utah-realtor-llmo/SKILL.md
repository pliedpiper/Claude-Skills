# Utah Realtor LLMO

Help Utah real estate agents get recommended by AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) through LLM Optimization strategies.

## What is LLMO?

LLM Optimization (LLMO) is the practice of optimizing a brand's digital presence to appear in AI-generated responses. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on ranking in search results, LLMO focuses on being *mentioned and recommended* when users ask AI assistants questions like "Who is the best realtor in Salt Lake City?"

Key insight: AI tools don't rank websites—they synthesize information from training data and web sources to recommend specific entities. Getting recommended requires building a clear, consistent, authoritative digital footprint.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Request

Determine what the user needs:
- **Research mode**: Latest LLMO strategies and tactics
- **Audit mode**: Review their current web presence
- **Recommendations mode**: Specific action items
- **Content creation**: Help write optimized content

Most requests benefit from a combination of these.

### Step 2: Research Current LLMO Best Practices

If the user wants current strategies, search for recent information:

```
Search queries:
- "LLMO real estate agent [current year]"
- "get recommended by ChatGPT local business [current month year]"
- "AI optimization real estate [current month year]"
```

Key LLMO principles:
1. **Entity clarity**: AI must clearly understand who you are, what you do, where you operate
2. **Third-party validation**: Mentions on authoritative sites matter more than self-promotion
3. **Structured data**: Schema markup helps AI parse your information
4. **Consistency**: Identical NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all platforms
5. **Content depth**: Original insights beat generic content
6. **Conversational format**: Content structured as Q&A performs better

**Fallback if searches yield limited results:**
- Rely on the principles above as baseline guidance
- Check industry sources directly: Search Engine Journal, Neil Patel, HubSpot for general LLMO advice
- Note to the user that LLMO is an emerging field and best practices are still evolving
- Focus on fundamentals: consistency, authority, and structured data

### Step 3: Conduct Web Presence Audit

If the user provides their name, website, or business info, audit their presence:

1. **Search for their profiles**:
   - Google: "[Agent Name] real estate Utah"
   - Check Zillow, Realtor.com, Google Business Profile

2. **Test AI mentions** (user must do this themselves—you cannot test on their behalf):
   - Ask ChatGPT: "Who are the best real estate agents in [their city], Utah?"
   - Ask Claude, Perplexity, Gemini the same
   - Note if they appear, what's said, what sources are cited
   - Provide the user with these exact prompts to test and report back

3. **Check for issues**:
   - Inconsistent information across platforms
   - Missing profiles on key sites
   - Thin or generic content
   - No schema markup
   - No reviews or testimonials

Reference the checklist: `references/llmo-checklist.md` (if available; otherwise, use the audit criteria in Step 3)

### Step 4: Provide Recommendations

Prioritize recommendations by impact:

**High Impact (Do First):**
- Complete Google Business Profile with Q&A section
- Claim and optimize Zillow profile (frequently cited by ChatGPT)
- Ensure NAP consistency across all platforms
- Add RealEstateAgent and LocalBusiness schema to website
- Collect and respond to reviews

**Medium Impact:**
- Create neighborhood guide content for service areas
- Build FAQ pages with conversational questions
- Get mentioned in local news/directories
- Optimize LinkedIn headline and About section

**Lower Impact (Long-term):**
- Podcast appearances and guest posts
- Create YouTube content (indexed by Perplexity/Gemini)
- Target "best of" lists and awards

### Step 5: Create Optimized Content (If Requested)

When writing content for LLMO:

**Bio/About Page Structure:**
```
[Full Name] is a [credentials] real estate agent serving [specific Utah cities/counties].
Specializing in [specialty, e.g., first-time homebuyers], [Name] has helped [X] families

[Unique value proposition - what makes them different]

[Service areas with specific neighborhoods]

```

**FAQ Content Structure:**
```

**Neighborhood Guide Structure:**
